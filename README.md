This is a repository of my personal solutions to Project Euler problems implemented using Python. I come from a teaching background with mathematics, and tried to document my scripts as much as I could to explain what I was doing from a mathematical standpoint. Feel free to email me at jahess150@gmail.com if you have any questions or want any clarification on any of my solutions! If any problems require more than one file, I will create a folder for that problem instead. More complicated problems that are better explained outside of code will include their own `README.md` file that can explain the solution in more detail. Thank you for checking out my solutions!
